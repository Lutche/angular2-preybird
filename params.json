  "body": "# Programmer Per: Angular 2 \r\n\r\nThis is a project for presenting me, \"[Per the Programmer](http://www.programmerper.com)\".\r\n\r\nThe application is built with __Angular 2__, __TypeScript__, __SASS__ and tested with __Jasmine__ & __Protractor__ \r\nin a behaviour-driven manner. It also has a bit of __Gulp__ but is configured mainly with __npm__.\r\n _More to come ..._\r\n\r\nI believe in the future of Semantic Web Components, modular and testable. My intention is to build this app in \r\nsuch a manner.\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\n## Get Started\r\n1. `git clone https://github.com/perjo927/angular2-preybird.git`\r\n2. `npm install`\r\n3. `npm start`\r\n4. You browser should open. If not,go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\r\n\r\n## Run tests / TDD\r\n\r\n### Unit tests\r\n\r\n1. `npm test`\r\n2. Your browser should open. If it doesn't, go to: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/unit-tests.html](http://127.0.0.1:8080/unit-tests.html)\r\n3. For test-driven development, keep the browser tab open while developing, and the tests will live-reload. \r\nYou can run  `npm start` & `npm test` simultaneously, since the development and test servers run on different ports, and the development\r\nserver will also live-reload.\r\n\r\n### End-to-end tests\r\n1. `npm run e2e-test`\r\n2. Webdriver should now open a browser and run the end-to-end tests.\r\n\r\n## CI\r\n_Coming soon_",
